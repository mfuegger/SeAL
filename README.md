# Sensitivity Analyzer for Asynchronous Logic (SeAL)

SeAL is a Python library to analyze the sensitivity of circuits, in particular asynchronous and QDI circuits, to
faults.

## Example use



## Algorithm

SeAL is used in the article "On the Susceptibility of QDI Circuits to Transient Faults" (El Shehaby, Fuegger, Steininger, FORMATS'23)
to analyze the sensitivity of QDI circuits to transient faults.
Please see the paper for a discussion and proof of the algorithm.
